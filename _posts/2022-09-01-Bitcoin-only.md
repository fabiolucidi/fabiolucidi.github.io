There're tons of reasons to start using Bitcoin: the main is probably _investing_ into something _valuable_. Most of the people I know started trading Bitcoin for this reason and then, a few of them, started their journey into the _bitcoin rabbit hole_.
Sooner or later everyone of them faced (or will face) an important decision, asking themselves one or more of the following:
- should I go into _other crypto_?
- should I add some _altcoins_ to my portfolio?
- why I'm not differentiating my investment?

Being attracted by other _coins_ is normal, but it's also one of the worst mistakes a _new comer_ could do: Bitcoin is the only option we have. **If you have no time to read the entire post and want to blindly trust me (I always advise against that) get out with this: focus all your efforts on Bitcoin only, i.e. your investments and before that your studies. It's the safest solution you have from every point of view.**

Now, if you have a couple of minutes here are some reasons why everyone should trash every coin other than Bitcoin.

{: toc}

# 1. History
Bitcoin, as a working implementation, is here since the [3rd of January 2009](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block). The paper behind that implementation is here since the [31st of October 2008](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html). All the other so called _cyptos_ or _altcoins_ were born **years** later: this is not a problem per se, but we can say without any doubt that Bitcoin has the longest stability track-record in the industry (in the world). The protocol proved its efficiency ever since so any feature has been stress tested like no other feature of no other _chain of blocks_.

# 2. Security
The first point - time - demonstrates also a good part of the second: since the Bitcoin protocol hasn't been hacked ever since, we can safely say that the protocol itself is the most secure. Also, since it's the most valuable _crypto asset_, we can assume it's also the _most targeted_ by _attackers_ (acting for their own profit or for academic reasons) so, again, the most stress tested. But this could be tautological. The reality is that Bitcoin is the most secure _asset_ also without taking longevity into account: it's _secure by design_ because it's based on the best cryptographical solutions available. To _crack_ Bitcoin security - let's say the immutability of a block - you should _crack_ the algorithms underlying all our visible world, like credit cards, military codes, etc. If that happens Bitcoin will be the last thing you'll be worried of. One additional reason: its design doesn't offer any incentive to a rational player to attack it and destroy it, it would be like cutting the branch you're sit on or cut your arm off. \
(_sorry for these two figures of speech: they are probably very Italian, but I really like them_)
One more reason? If you'll have to protect _all_ your _cryptos_ you'll have to protect each one of them, so every single one would require an additional (and probably different) effort exposing another _surface of attack_: it will be harder for you (for anyone) to protect more assets. You will end wasting time or money, or both. Even if you trust a very good multi-asset wallet the chances for that to be broken, for at least one asset, are higher and you could lose something. Going Bitcoin only is just safer as it is simpler.

# 3. Governance
We could say that Bitcoin is governed by nobody/anybody and fully decentralized but this wouldn't be 100% true. There're some aspects where a group of people _could_ weight more than others - at least in the proposal mechanism - but the decision process is based on a specific, clear (ex-ante) consensus mechanism. The decision, about proposals (BIPs), are ultimately taken by the network based on their contribution. Most of all, any of these _gray spots_, is better than any other _crypto asset_ governance systems. Most of them are centralized by design or _de facto_ through different mechanism that allow companies or individuals to exercise any arbitrary decision they take. This is the case of many famous _altcoins_ and it's also the root cause of their limits: centralized governance is no different from _fiat_ currencies without a central bank (which is in the end a source of trust) - so it's more like _fake money_ rather than _USD_ or _EUR_ - and without any provable track record of a whatsoever kind of reliability. Investing in a _crypto asset_ governed by a centralized authority means giving your asset property rights to a rule-maker that could (and sooner or later will) rule against your interest, if it doesn't match theirs.

# 4. Community
Bitcoin is supported by the largest community. This is beyond the _industry_ (btw, another pro), it's all about the amount of people talking daily about #Bitcoin, learning and trying to push Bitcoin forward: **it's the innovation engine**. The community could look like a soft reason, but it's not: having on your side the best minds in the world constantly working to add another innovation to the protocol is crucial. Another important point is how this community work: it's not closed, on the contrary it's very open but also, luckily, challenging. **Any single proposal matters for its content and not for its author's name.**
On top of this - and yes this is a soft reason - it's the best at doing memes (and merch). You won't find a more heterogenous community with those skills defending and improving their product.

# 5. Asset value
Bitcoin is an asset with its intrinsic value, first big difference with any other coin. **The value - not the price - comes from the innovation, the community, the security, the history and the expectations**. Bitcoin is a stronghold for all of those believing in a different kind of money (_Hayek_?), in a free world, in a different internet, in the web of trust, more in general in a world where _proved work_ is valued and not a _stake_ or an interest. Money, and the decisions about it, is the root cause of many world problems (famine, poverty, etc.) as well as the instrument that enabled amazing discoveries and prosperity. Bitcoin summarizes all the positive features we - as humanity - have understood money should have. So, **it's hope**. No _altcoin_ has this drive, so don't waste a second on those.

# 6. Market value
I've put this at the very end because that's exactly what I think. If I had 147 reasons to talk about why going Bitcoin only, I'd have put this as the 147th. **Market value is not a root cause of the Bitcoin success, is the consequence**. Getting into Bitcoin _because of the market value_ means investing without knowing, which is always a bad decision: if you don't know what you're investing in, it'd very difficult for you to understand how to protect your investment and you will ultimately trust someone (or something). And this is exactly the problem Bitcoin, as an invention, solves: it allows a trustless environment to work without a trust authority. You don't need to trust anyone, just yourself! \
All the other coins don't solve this or any other problem: best case they replicate Bitcoin, but without one or more of the points from 1 to 5. So, once again, there's no much sense in buying some _alt_/_shit_-coin: their market value is lower by at least a 10x factor because of all these reasons. Don't do that! Go Bitcoin only!!!
