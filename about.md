# Bio
My name is Fabio, I live in Milan where I work in consulting both in Financial Services and Technology. \
I'm an eclectic person interested in economy, politics, innovation, sports and other topics. Generally speaking I enjoy understanding how things work getting my hands dirty if possible. I often hate being interested in many different topics because it prevents me from focusing on one thing at a time (ending up in not focusing at all), but in the end I always realize that the best part is to connect all the dots,, so the more dots you see, learn or understand, the more connections you can make. \
This creates in me the need to write, every once in a while, some thoughts down: this blog is the _place_ I built for the purpose. It's a completely free and independent space where I don't count visits or clicks, don't gather information about visitors, with no ads and where I write without any obligation or frequency. It's always been like that since my first blogging experience back in early 2000s and it will always be like this.  
Long story short, this is just a simple space for simple things because authentic things **are** simple, secure and [privacy friendly](/policy).

# Vision
> In general, I hope to contribute to a world where we value skills and relationships over careers and money, where we know better than to trust cops or politicians, and where we're passionate about building and creating things in a self-motivated and self-directed way.

# Collaborations
Thanks to my work and my personal interests I have a certain experience in Bitcoin and privacy that drove me to hold some **_pro bono_ classes for people starting from zero** without any technical knowledge. I'm always available to talk about **Bitcoin**, **privacy**, **web of trust** in public events (classes, panels, talks, etc.) and I'll gladly do it _pro bono_ if the event is free of charge for the attendees. For any additional information you can ask me through the [contact page](/contact).
