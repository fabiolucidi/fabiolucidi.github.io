# README

## fabiolucidi.it
I started blogging many years ago. I cant' remember the year, let's say something between 2003 and 2004. I  used several different platforms coming in the end to Wordpress that I left at the very beginning of 2022 to join the Github Pages and Jekyll communities. My blog is hosted on github and can be reached from my usual custom domain [www.fabiolucidi.it](https://www.fabiolucidi.it).

## why
I need blogging to do the thinking exercise...I see, read, etc. many things so writing allows me to think about things and share the idea with people. I don't need money or anything from this activity, I just like to do things in a proper way hoping that this helps someone else.

## contribute
You can contribute to this repo. I'm not an expert so if you see weird things please feel free to fork and "pull request" me to merge. Fork as many times as you like, I'll be pleased to help you someway with your Github Pages site.
