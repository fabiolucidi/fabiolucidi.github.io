## fabiolucidi.it
Hi and welcome on my GitHub Pages repo!
fabiolucidi.it is my one and only blog: I started blogging many years ago, I cant' remember the year, let's say something between 2003 and 2004. I  used several different platforms over the years ending up to Wordpress that I left at the very beginning of 2022 joining the Github Pages and Jekyll communities. My blog is hosted on github and can be reached through my usual custom domain [www.fabiolucidi.it](https://www.fabiolucidi.it) as well as the [github.io](https://fabiolucidi.github.io) link.

## How can I be sure this site is legitimate
In case you have doubts about this site or its author you can independently check two facts.

### Verify posts are my own
On the website you can find my [public keys](https://www.fabiolucidi.it/keys) including the RSA that I use to sign every GitHub commit. Since every post I publish requires a commit you can be sure that it is legitimate - published by me - by checking the _Verified_ green flag added by GitHub (aka _Vigilant mode_) directly from the [repository commits page](https://github.com/fabiolucidi/fabiolucidi.github.io/commits/main).

### Verify the site is up to date
The last version of the site is the one generated by the last commit. In the footer of every page you can find a 7 digits string and that you can compare with the one in the [repository commits page](https://github.com/fabiolucidi/fabiolucidi.github.io/commits/main): if the two strings are the same you're reading the last version of the site. The 7 digits are just the first 7 of a longer string, so don't worry if opening one commit you'll see a even longer string: if the firs 7 digits are the ones reported in the footer section of the site you're good.

## Why are you still blogging?
I need blogging to do the thinking exercise...I observe, read, watch things etc. these "things" are so many that every once in a while I need to take a moment to think about it: writing allows me to do the job with the huge plus of sharing my posts with the world. I don't need money or anything from this activity (so, no ads, no analytics, etc.), I just like to post and share when I need it and do it in a aesthetically pleasant way hoping that what I write inspires or helps someone else.

## Contribute
You can of course contribute to this repository. I'm not an expert in anything related to Git or Jekyll, I've just learned the basics so if you see weird things please feel free to fork and "pull request" me to merge your suggestions. Fork as many times as you like, I'll be pleased to help you someway with your Github Pages site.

### A quasi-exception
If you fork this repository you could probably get my drafts that are encrypted: they are useless, so my suggestion is to delete the entire folder. I encrypt my drafts just to avoid spoilers for my readers :)
